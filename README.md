# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with weather information for various cities. It leverages the OpenWeather API to retrieve and display both current and future weather conditions. The project was developed to enhance skills in integrating third-party APIs and deploying full-stack applications. This dashboard solves the problem of quickly accessing weather data for trip planning or other needs. Throughout this project, I learned how to connect a front-end application with a back-end service and deploy it using Render.
